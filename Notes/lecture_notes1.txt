Things that take time:
 - characters/sprite
 - animations

Make sure the entire game actually works!

CONTENT - The stories! The levels!
This takes so much damn time, do it as soon as possible...

TESTING -  User testing!
Get your game into people's hands!

POLISH - Oooh, sparkly...
For every action, there is a reaction. Professional quality!

GOOD GAMES ARE SIMPLE, FUN, REMARKABLE
MAKE THE GAME YOU THINK IS COOL

Checklist:
1. Would this game be simple enough for players to learn in under a minute?
2. What is the core loop?
3. Can you design a good control scheme for mobile? How long of a tutorial would you need?
4. Would this game be simple enough to finish by August 15th?
5. Consider coding, content, testing, tutorial, and polish.
6. Would this game be fun?
7. How similar is this game to an existing one?
8. Would this game be remarkable?
9. Would you play it?

Idea: A puzzle game. There is a line in the sand. What happens on this side of the line, will happen on the other side. Collect the keys and unlock the door to advance.

WHY AN MVP?

You're new, no one will remember your terrible first version.
It's an expensive mistake to build features players don't use.

List the features you would want to implement immediately after launch/include in the initial launch.

There is a line on the sand, but you never cross the line. When you jump across, everything is exactly the same, simply flipped across the x & y axis.

Idea:
Adventure puzzle game?
Dungeons, rather than levels?

Overworld, with many doors (leading to each level)?
